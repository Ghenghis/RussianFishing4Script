# RF4S Phase-Based Development Blueprint

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

The RF4S ecosystem upgrade will be developed using a **phase-based approach** where each phase is:
- **Working & Testable**: Can be run and validated independently
- **Modular**: Follows strict 200-line file limits and component isolation
- **Branch-Based**: Each phase gets its own GitHub branch
- **Skip-Friendly**: Phases can be developed in any order
- **Seamlessly Integrated**: All phases work together as a unified system

## 🏗️ **Core Architecture Principles**

### Modular File System Rules
- **Maximum 200 lines per file** (strictly enforced)
- **Single responsibility** per component
- **Component isolation** with own directories
- **Clear dependencies** and minimal coupling
- **Testable design** with independent components

### Directory Structure
