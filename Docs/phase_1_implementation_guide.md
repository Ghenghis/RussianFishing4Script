**Branch**: `phase-1-ui-layout`
**Status**: 80% Complete - Ready for Final Polish

## âœ… **What's Already Done**

### Core Infrastructure (Complete)
- âœ… `rf4s_ui/core/service_registry.py` - Dependency injection system
- âœ… `rf4s_ui/core/event_manager.py` - Inter-component communication
- âœ… `rf4s_ui/core/component_loader.py` - Dynamic component loading
- âœ… `rf4s_ui/core/application.py` - Main application core
- âœ… `main.py` - Application entry point

### Basic Components (Implemented)
- âœ… `rf4s_ui/components/panel_manager/` - Panel management system
- âœ… `rf4s_ui/components/theme_manager/` - Theme and styling
- âœ… `rf4s_ui/components/settings_manager/` - Settings persistence
- âœ… `rf4s_ui/ui/main_window.py` - Main application window

## ðŸ”§ **Phase 1 Completion Tasks**

### Task 1: Polish Main Window UI
**File**: `rf4s_ui/ui/main_window.py`
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Ensure proper PyQt6 + Fluent-Widgets integration
- [ ] Implement resizable multi-panel layout (2, 3, or 4 panels)
- [ ] Add proper window controls (minimize, maximize, close)
- [ ] Implement menu bar with basic options
- [ ] Add status bar for system information

### Task 2: Complete Panel Manager
**File**: `rf4s_ui/components/panel_manager/`
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Panel switching functionality
- [ ] Panel resize and layout persistence
- [ ] Panel content placeholder system
- [ ] Panel configuration options
- [ ] Panel state management

### Task 3: Enhance Theme Manager
**File**: `rf4s_ui/components/theme_manager/`
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Dark/Light theme switching
- [ ] Custom color schemes
- [ ] Font size and family options
- [ ] Theme persistence across sessions
- [ ] Real-time theme preview

### Task 4: Settings Manager Integration
**File**: `rf4s_ui/components/settings_manager/`
**Requirements**:
- [ ] UI layout settings (panel sizes, positions)
- [ ] Theme preferences
- [ ] Window state (size, position, maximized)
- [ ] User preferences
- [ ] Settings validation and defaults

### Task 5: Create Test Suite
**Directory**: `rf4s_ui/tests/phase_1/`
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Application launch test
- [ ] Panel resize test
- [ ] Theme switching test
- [ ] Settings persistence test
- [ ] UI responsiveness test

## ðŸ§ª **Phase 1 Test Criteria**

### Functional Tests
```python
def test_application_launch():
    """Test that application launches without errors"""
    pass

def test_panel_management():
    """Test panel creation, resize, and switching"""
    pass

def test_theme_switching():
    """Test theme changes and persistence"""
    pass

def test_settings_persistence():
    """Test that settings save and load correctly"""
    pass

def test_ui_responsiveness():
    """Test that UI responds to user interactions"""
    pass
```

### Manual Test Checklist
- [ ] Application launches without errors
- [ ] Main window displays correctly
- [ ] Panels can be resized and layout persists
- [ ] Theme switching works (dark/light)
- [ ] Settings save when application closes
- [ ] Settings load when application starts
- [ ] Window state persists (size, position)
- [ ] All UI elements are responsive
- [ ] No memory leaks during normal operation

## ðŸš€ **Phase 1 Completion Steps**

### Step 1: Create Phase 1 Branch
```bash
git checkout -b phase-1-ui-layout
```

### Step 2: Polish Existing Components
- Review and enhance main window implementation
- Ensure panel manager works perfectly
- Complete theme manager functionality
- Validate settings manager integration

### Step 3: Create Test Suite
- Implement automated tests for all functionality
- Create manual testing checklist
- Validate all test criteria pass

### Step 4: Documentation
- Update component documentation
- Create user guide for Phase 1 features
- Document any known limitations

### Step 5: Validation
- Run all automated tests
- Complete manual testing checklist
- Performance validation (startup time, memory usage)
- Code quality validation (linting, formatting)

## ðŸ“‹ **Phase 1 Deliverables**

### Working Application
